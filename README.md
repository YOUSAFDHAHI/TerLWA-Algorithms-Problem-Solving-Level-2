Problem-Solving with Algorithms - Level 2

This repository contains solutions to 50 algorithm challenges written in C++. These challenges are part of the "Algorithms and Problem Solving" course taught by Dr. Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud.

The solutions are structured to focus on clean and modular coding practices, with an emphasis on organizing code into libraries to promote reusability and maintainability.

This course has been a valuable experience in enhancing my skills in problem decomposition, code optimization, and structured programming.
